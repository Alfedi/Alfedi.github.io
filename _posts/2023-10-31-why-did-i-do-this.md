In fact this is a very good question. The most immediate answer is I'm bored. Like a lot.

Additionally, I just want to know how it's like to have a blog on GitHub, the best social network IMO.

"Why is it the best?", "Who are you?" or "Please, let me go" are the most frequent answers you would get talking about this. Right now, I can only answer the first question.

## Why is GitHub the best social network?
Basically because it's not Twitter (I completely refuse to call it *X*). Here everybody is talking about their projects and all their nerd stuff (I wish I could talk more about my nerd stuff).

Software communities are lucky that [almost never][scala_nazis]{:target="_blank"} are filled with fucking nazis or at least, I believe, it's not common.

Also, I have a bad obession about making GitHub a **real** social network. I believe this kind of blog could be the solution.

## But... Why GitHub and not X?
*X as any other social network.*

As it turns out, I recently discover [IndieWeb][indie_web]{:target="_blank"} philosphy and I found out very curious and just what I was looking for. So I decided to test it.

So, step by step I will modify this blog in order to pursue the [POSSE][POSSE]{:target="_blank"} philosophy.

I will post here anything about my journey. But I warn you, maybe this web is dead the next week or something (Let's hope not).
